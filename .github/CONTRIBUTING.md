# Contributing

We are always looking for people of all backgrounds and levels of experience to help improve this project. There are a 
variety of different ways to contribute. We ask that you follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow 
these guidelines when creating a contribution.

## Getting Started

A good first step to learn more about this project is to check out our docs located in the wiki section of Github. The 
docs are intended to provide helpful information to both users and contributors. Our docs could always be better so if
you think they are lacking somewhere, check out the [documentation](#documentation) section to help up improve.

Another great way to get started is to join our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/parameterized-builds/Lobby)! 
Introduce yourself and we'll do our best to assist you towards your first or latest contribution.

## Contribution Types

### Bug Reports

Bug reports should be submitted through a Github issue. Follow the [issue template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to provide an
appropriate amount of information in your report.

### Bug Fixes

Before fixing a bug, make sure there is a bug report open. If not, please open one so that the issue can be tracked.
Once an issue is open, mention in the issue that you would like to work on it so we can see where work is being done.

### Enhancements

Like bug fixes, enhancements should have an issue opened ahead of time. Doing so will allow feedback on the feature so
development effort will not be wasted and the scope of the enhancement is well-defined.

Currently opened and unassigned enhancement requests are open to anyone to work on. If you are interested in an issue 
that is open but assigned, create a comment voicing your interest anyways. There may be room for collaboration and, at
worst, it will show that the enhancement is a desired feature.

### Documentation

Minor documentation updates such as typo fixes do not need approval to make. More significant updates like adding a 
new page or a new section to a page should first be approved by a code owner. A request can be made through Gitter and a 
core member will then work with you to make the update.

### Misc

There are plenty of ways to contribute outside of code such as providing general feedback or answering user questions. 
If there is some way you'd like to contribute that isn't covered, ask about it in Gitter.
